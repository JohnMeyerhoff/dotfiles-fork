# Overview

I have been a developer since 2011. Throughout the years I have had a strong passion for building the most production developer environment possible. I spend countless hours tweaking my system and adjusting to my specific needs as my work changes over the years.

In 2020, I decided to go full-time into the terminal. Dropping tools like vscode and replacing it with tmux and neovim.

This is my, always-up-to-date, documentation and source code for my developer environment, enjoy.

## Operating Systems

I currently am using the following operating systems:
- [macOS (Big Sur)](https://www.apple.com/macos/big-sur/): I have been using macOS since 2009. It's "ecosystem" is incredibly helpful when using a mac/iPhone/iPad. I have tried to make the switch to Linux full-time and there are just too many amazing tools, apps, and shortcuts that make me the most productive.
- [iPadOS](https://www.apple.com/ipados/ipados-14/): There's a surprising amount of development I can do with [BlinkShell](https://blink.sh) to SSH into my other dev machines.
- [PopOS](https://pop.system76.com): I switched from plain Ubuntu to PopOS because it has a wonderful window manager built-in and supports all the same commands and package managers as Ubuntu.
- [Ubuntu (Server)](https://ubuntu.com/download/server): Ubuntu is well supported and can run anywhere with solid package managers and an easy to learn developer environment.
