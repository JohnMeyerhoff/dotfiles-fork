# Overview

I have been a developer since 2011. Throughout the years I have had a strong passion for building the most production developer environment possible. I spend countless hours tweaking my system and adjusting to my specific needs as my work changes over the years.

In 2020, I decided to go full-time into the terminal. Dropping tools like vscode and replacing it with tmux and neovim.

This is my, always-up-to-date, documentation and source code for my developer environment, enjoy.

## Operating Systems

I currently am using the following operating systems.

### macOS (Big Sur)

I have been using macOS since 2009. It's "ecosystem" is incredibly helpful when using a mac/iPhone/iPad. I have tried to make the switch to Linux full-time and there are just too many amazing tools, apps, and shortcuts that make me the most productive.

- [yabai](/yabai): window manager
- [Alfred](/alfred): productivity app
- [Pika](/pika): color picker
- [SpaceLauncher](/spacelauncher): app launcher and switcher

### iPadOS

There's a surprising amount of development I can do with [BlinkShell](https://blink.sh) to SSH into my other dev machines.

### PopOS

I switched from plain Ubuntu to PopOS because it has a wonderful window manager built-in and supports all the same commands and package managers as Ubuntu.

### Ubuntu (Server)

Ubuntu is well supported and can run anywhere with solid package managers and an easy to learn developer environment.
